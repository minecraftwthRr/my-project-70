  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd> starbucks roastery</kbd></h4>
 
  <hr >

  <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >i had visited in dec 2019</h5>
Starbucks’s massive four-story coffee shop and roastery, the one that’s replacing Crate & Barrel’s Michigan Avenue store, should open on November 15. The coffee chain’s flashy Chicago flagship will occupy a 43,000-square-foot space and will serve pizza. It’ll also have a bar with cocktails from Chicago bartenders including Eater Young Gun Julia Momose, caretaker of the drinks at Japanese-inspired Kumiko and Michelin-starred Oriole, both in the West Loop.

The store, at the corner of Erie and Michigan (646 N. Michigan Avenue) is billed as the world’s-largest Starbucks. The Tribune also reported that Starbucks has enlisted bartenders Annie Beebe-Tron (Fat Rice) and Rachel Miller (Community Tavern) to create the cocktail menu.

Starbucks, like other retailers and restaurants, is vying to give customers more of a reason to visit stores rather than to rely on online ordering and deliveries. Company officials want this flagship to have a theatrical element and to entertain patrons. As the Trib pointed out, the coffee company has tried these types of shops in Milan, Italy; New York; Seattle; Shanghai; and Tokyo. Momose and Beebe-Tron were also involved in creating the drinks for Starbucks in those cities.

Back in September 2018, Starbucks unveiled the first U.S. location of Princi in the West Loop. Princi is an Italian bakery which Starbucks partnered with to bring its breads, pastries, and other baked goods to America. The Michigan Avenue location will also have a full kitchen to serve Princi’s full menu, including square-cut pizzas.   </div>

  <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>niagra falls</kbd></h4>
 
  <hr >

  <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize" >i had visited in april 2018</h5>

  <p class="text-muted text-left" > Niagara Falls is actually made up of three separate waterfalls: the American Falls, the Bridal Veil Falls (named for its resemblance to a bride's veil) and the largest, the Horseshoe Falls.
 The first person to survive a trip over Niagara Falls in a barrel was a 63-year-old schoolteacher. Seeking fame and fortune, Annie Taylor loaded herself – and her cat – up in a barrel and descended over the falls in 1901.
 It is illegal to make an attempt to go over the Falls, and those who do so are fined $10,000.

 <p>Saw it today with my kids and they loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge ofAnt Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because ut does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

      </h5>
   <p>Bottom Line: The film will bring back the magic for your t(w)een, who was a fan of the original. But, it could be too intense for preschoolers. There are some spoilers below in the full review. Full Review: While it had some great songs, and I thought better instrumental music, I still like the music from the original better. The reprise of "Into the Unknown" at the end of the movie is sung by Panic! At the Disco - clearly meant to appeal to the original Frozen fans, who are now tweens and teens.</p>
